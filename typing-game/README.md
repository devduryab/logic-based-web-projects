🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Typing Speed Game! 🎮⌨️

I recently developed a Typing Speed Game using React, focusing on enhancing typing skills while having fun. Here's a quick overview of its features:

1.Random Paragraph Fetching: Fetches random paragraphs from an API to keep the game fresh.
2.Real-Time Typing Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback on their typing accuracy and mistakes.
3.WPM and CPM Metrics: Calculates and displays words and characters typed per minute.
4.Timer Functionality: A 60-second countdown timer to challenge players.
5.Confetti Celebration: Fun confetti animation upon successfully typing the paragraph!
